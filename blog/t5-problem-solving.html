            ...To be very honest since the time I have started working with JavaScript my heart has started beating really fast.
            I don't want to say about any one problem where I got stuck and eventually managed to solved,but I will just say every
            assignment (javascript)is been a challenge for me so far. I am not sure how others feel about that, and what their experience is.  As for me It's hard to get concepts right.
            Also there is a lot to learn and understand. I have got stuck almost on every challegne but, I tried my best until it was all just too over-whelming and broke down and lot's of tears rolled down.
            Then I asked the help from my husband, who is my coach at home and I feel lucky to have him.
             He explained me all the questions which I had in my mind, and ended up giving me Home work to do which I am still working on. From the beginning of javascript understanding data types and whats there role,
             to loops,functions,switch statements control flow. and Syntax..etc.. etc.. everything is still a challenge.
              During this hard phase the tecniques which I used was console.log, lot's of googling, free courses, reading error messages and triyng different code in dev tools.
             Even though I am giving my best I feel there is a long way to go before JavaScript starts making sense, as Harrison once said give some time, it takes a while to sink in with javascript.
             I am still keeping very positive and trying to keep up my spirits. I know going from being Chef to  be a Programmer is tough road but I am enjoying my journey.

 <p>Here is my little understnding about following methods and I am still working on them.
  .map() method helps to iterates every value in the array and returns the value required, without having to use for() loop.
 In other words it can give you individual information about the items by picking one at a time from big box of things.</p>


 <p>
   .filter() getting the unique values or names from an Array by using the .filter method.
 Filter method is like a filter who will sort out what you want and return it you from big box of things.</p>

 <p>
   .reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
  in other words It takes an Array and turn into something else.It takes three parameters (all, item ,Index).
 I am still quite confused with .reduce() method so will keep it for now and study more and get back to it again.</p>
