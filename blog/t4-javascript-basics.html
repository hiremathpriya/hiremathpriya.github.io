            How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</p>
            <p>

              HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used for the design of a webpage â€“ where everything is placed and how it looks
JavaScript is used to define the interactive elements of a webpage that help to engage user.</p>

<p>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</p>
 <p>

 Control flow relates to the order in which tasks or code is run. For example:
<ul>
<li>

Wake up</li>
<li>


Tired => Press snooze</li>
<li>


Not tired => Get out of bed</li>

Loops on the other hand, iterate over the same peice of code until the condition turns false. For example:
<li>


Go to bathroom and brush teeth</li>
<li>


Are teeth clean?</li>
<li>


No => Action: Up then down</li>
<li>


Yes => Stop Brushing </li></p></ul>
<p>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</p>
<p>
   Arrays and object literals can contain items. The difference between them is how those items are stored.
  With arrays they will just be a list of items: 20, willis street, salesman, however,
  with object literals we can go a step further to give ID's to each of the object items: Age: 20, Area of work: willis St, Ocupation: salesman.
They also differ in how we access those values.
With Object literals, you access their values using dot notation (console.log(person.location);), with arrays, you access the values using numerical index (console.log(array[2]);)</p>

 <p> Exlain what functions are and why they are useful.</p>
<p>

 In Javascript a function is a block of code that is designed to perform a particular task. These are executed when something calls that function.

 For Example, you could set up a key press to trigger a function, that function could do anything, from move a player in a game forward, to submit a for or change a website to a mobile view.</p>

    <h2>Tech-Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What is grid base design?</li>
      <li>What all the hype about responsive webpages?</li>
      <li>What is semantic structure?</li>
      <li>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Grid base design is two dimensional where it is made up with the series of
          interesting straight, verttical or horizontal lines used to structure the content.
          Grid base design follows a pattern where we start from top and top bottom.
          Almost every webpage follows some sort of grid base pattern or design.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the hype about responsive design today is because now a days people
          are using more and more devices like Tablets,Phones etc. Saying that all these
          devices has got a different size of screens to show the same content of the
          web-page. when we say size of the screen it's actually the pixals which are
          changing the size of page to fit.
          With responsive desgin your web-page will not be fixed to single size
          and it will response correctly with no matter which device you are using.
          It will show the content correctly, great and eligible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semantic structure helps orgnaise the content on the web-page in more sensible
          way. Semantic structure uses tags which are like header,where you can have
          h1 to h6 tags, also Images,Form etc.
          Semantic structure tags make sense to not only for the browser but also for humans
          looking at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have found the whole grid structure very interesting also it's quite confusing.
          I would like to spend some more time exploring this again.
