              Personally I haven't had any compassionate leadership experience but knowing how it will work from going from "I" to "WE" will certainly add an excellent quality in a leader.
              Understanding following componants to be a good leader is the key to success.
              <ul>

                <li> A cognitive component:  “I understand you”</li>
                <li> An affective component: “I feel for you”</li>
                <li>A motivational component: “I want to help you”</li> </ul></P>

                <strong>Multiplying goodness meditation </strong> I find this concept very interesting for meditaiton, I wasn't sure how the meditation will go for me.
                But I have given it a go at it. The concept basically says to see the goodness in others and your own selves,
                This meditation talks about the following concept..
                <strong>“connecting with the goodness within ourselves: our love, compassion, altruism, and inner joy, and visualizing that good-ness radiating out of from our body”</strong>
                <p>

                  While mediating my mind wandered a lot, But made me scan all the goodness I have within myself but truly I felt it's a task to measure yourself. which normally you don't do it for your ownself.
                  I guess it may take a while to see that light, and needs a lot of meditation practice.
                  The meditation  part where thinking about others goodness went well saying that, even in that meditation I was unable to visualize the faint light, but certainly there are a few very close people in life who came in front of my eyes for thier goodness.
                  As far as the world population is concern for their goodness it wasn't easy to focus when you know what's happening in the real world today.
                  If only I could see that one faint light among all the individuals in the world we will be celebrating world peace and their goodness by now!
                  I am sure eveentually we can develop this goodness practice among each of us then absoultly we can see:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The goodness in self and others</li>
                    <li>Giving goodness to all</li>
                    <li>Confidence in the transformative power of self (that I can multiply goodness)</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>


                  <strong> The Tonglen meditation.</strong>

                  Tonglen meditation "It's about the generosity of an open heart and mind, we imagine ourself sitting in front of ourself, and Looking at our “ordinary self,” with its suffering—whatever may be troubles and sadnness inside.
                  we Breathe this in as if it is a dark cloud of gunk, and let it disperse and transform.
                  and Breathe it out as rays of light.” We do this for our ownself and for others who are suferring.
                  I found this quite useful in terms of seeing my ownself and my sufferings when I closed my eyes and had to think about what are my troubles  and sufferings at this stage then only one thing started rolling in my head was
                  a bubble...</P>
                  <p>

                    <img src="../images/speech-bubble sad face.jpg"width="200px" height="100px" /> </p>
                    <p>

                      A javascript bubble haunting me, Code.. code everywhere and I am lost in that bubble :) I could see my suffering here. But with the Tonglen meditation practice I feel it will make it easy to accept our suferings ,
                      and transform those suffering with the ray of light and understand ourselves better.</p>
                      <p>


                        Thinking about someone else's suferings Yes there are quite a few people about whom I feel and know their sufferings and wish I could relive their sufferings,
                        With meditation or without I can understand their pain and what they are going through, I hope that ray of light comes into their life soon as well.  </p>

                          Comparing SCARF model with the phase 0 experience so far,
                          Phase 0 experience is been very interesting, challenging, a big learning curve in my life so far.
                          SCARF model fits quite nicely with the phase 0 experience in terms of</p>
                          <strong>Status</strong>
                          <p>

                            “When you gain increasing mastery over something that matters to you, you activate a status reward, at least when compared against your former self.”
                            It is been like learning something for the first time and unable to understand a thing, but over the peroid of time you are getting really good at it. It's been expaclty like this with all the concepts in this phase 0 challenges.
                            when you look back at where you started and how much understanding you have gained by this time it's absoultly staus reward. for e.g When I started learning about HTML and now when I write a blog..it's a reward.</p>
                            <strong>Certinity</strong>
                            <p>
                              With phase 0 lot of the times you try to learn somethning but still can't get it and that's the time you start to get uncertain about your progress and it eats you inside. I think In phase 0 Certinity and uncertainity plays quite a big role.
                              “If you do not know whether your job is secure, uncertainty will probably occupy most of your mind and you may not be able to do much else at work.</p>
                              <strong>Autonomy</strong>
                              <p> It’s not the stress itself that gets to you; it’s the feeling of helplessness in the face of that stress. It is so true in phase 0 When you are so  stuck at some of the challenges and how hard you try to understand you still don't get it. Then it's that feeling of helplesness which actucally gets you, more than the stress.</P>
                                <strong>Relatedness</strong>

                                <p>This is the phase where you meet a lot of stangers and start your journey.
                                  “When you get to my age, you’ll measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. That’s the ultimate test of how you’ve lived your life.”
                                  By default, the brain labels someone a foe “unless proven otherwise. For example, strangers are usually labeled as foe (or at least, labeled as “approach at your own risk”). Fortunately, in many situations, it is not hard to switch people from foes to friends. For example, all it usually takes is a handshake and a pleasant conversation.</P>


                                  <strong>Fairness</strong>
                                  <p>Being fair to your ownself, others and your learning is the key.</p>

                                  <p>
                                    I am sure we will relate to the SCARF model during our Bootcamp phase as well, and it will help us to learn from these concepts and apply them into the right direction during the phase 1 experience.</p>
                                  </p>

                                    Having <strong>difficult converstaion </strong>is very difficult indeed. I have had a few experiences with that but the first one didn't really go well.
                                    second one was ok. I think it all depends on the tpoic of the converstaion, with whom you are having the converstaion
                                    , your understanding  between each other and the kind of relationship you share with the person.
                                    It's definetly not easy to do. One may get better at it with the practice.
                                    Letting other person know why you are having this conversation,
                                    and also how it matters to you. It may also help if you let them know that you care for them and using kind and gentle words may make it easy to discuss hard stuff.
                                    I feel one should always remember to choose the right and kind words while having difficult conversations as once the words are out, you can not reverse them back.
