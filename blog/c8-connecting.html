              Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</p>
              <p>
                I havn't really got the chance to use any of techniques for growing trust and sincerity until now. But I am sure “trust has to begin with sincerity, kindness, and openness,
                so it is optimally productive to start every relationship that way, both in work and in life. Whenever possible,
                begin by assuming that the other person is a good person and deserves to be treated as such, until proven otherwise.”


              </p>

              <p>People always talk about the Empathy, what is emapthy?? It's an awareness of the feelings and emotions of other people. When we try understand
                other persons emotions and feelings it helps us to be a better person in our life. I had small conversation with one of my friend recently, She had been going through a lot lately.
                It's been a while she wanted to tell me something, and I got the chance to meet her. I wanted to be a listner so asked her about what's going on with
                her. Things she told me were shocking and were upsetting thinking that these things actually do happen.
                I was completly lost in her conversation, she was telling me about workplace bullying, and how her work life is shattered at this point of her life and how it is affecting her personal life and health.
                There is nothing much she can do, with whatever reasons she may have. I listened to everything what she had to say.
                Job is important for her and she can not afford to loose it. I could feel her pain, and situation she is going through. She knows that I am there for her.
                That point of time I didnt wanted to say too much,all she wanted is someone to listen.</p>

                How did I find the loving kindness meditation?
              </p><p>
                Loving kindness meditation made me 'HAPPY'. It does makes sense for kindness towards other people to be natural way of rewarding ourselves, it is probably an important aspect for a human survival.
