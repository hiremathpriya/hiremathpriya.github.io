          <p class="blog-text question">

            How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</p>
            <p class="blog-text answer">

              "Process over product"concept is an amazing learning concept. This week for a mintue it was slight Panic
              when I had to redesign my website.What helped during this week was this concept, I know I am not an expert
              I am very much in learning stage and all I need to do is try my best and create something which I have never done it before.
              There are lot of mistakes and few concepts which I haven't completely understood yet. But I enjoyed the process of
              learning and creating. I feel proud what I have done so far, My product may not be perfect or fancy but it's simple straight forward.
              If we keep this concept in mind I think we will learn more.  Rather than spending hours and hours at this stage on making everything
              perfect. </p>
              <p class="blog-text question">
                What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
              </p>
              <p class="blog-text answer">
              Before reading chapter two of Search inside yourself my thoughts about meditation were very straight forward,


                Meditation is training your brain to increase attention span and getting benefited with calmness, concentration and happiness.</p>


                <p class="blog-text question">
                  What new things have you learnt about meditation?</p>
                  <p class="blog-text answer">
                    In this chapter I have learnt that

                    “Mindfulness trains two important faculties, attention and meta-attention”.There are also practices which focus
                    on relaxed concentration, also sustainable happiness can be achivevable by simply bringing attention to your
                    breath.I have also learned about about postures  and eyes and your movements and how they affect meditation.
                    This chapter also teaches you the basic technique and how to maintain mindfullness of intention,movement and
                    sensation and how to bring it back.</p>
