<P>

"Pleasure, Passion and Purpose"
For every individual these three "P"s are the most important aspect of thier lives
 and they represent the happiness of one's self.
 "pleasure is liked with instant feeling of satisfaction or gratification" and we all strive for that some or other time.
 when you look at the three "P"(Pleasure)this one is the shortest lived. As soon as the source of pleasure goes away
 our happiness drops. This  will  you bring us to think about the other "p" which is passion where one has this intense desire
 or enthusiasm for something. when we are in the flow of passion we are completely immersed in what we do and don't even realise how time has pass by.
 and absolutly passion can last longer than Pleasure.
 But Our journey dose not end here,  We all strive for inner peace and something which is beyond our minds. And thats when
 we start discovering the third "P" which is our Purpose in this life. It is the “highest” form of happiness and also the longest lasting.
 It is the feeling of true love and happiness in our life. It is the feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself. We all have purpose in our lives,
 It's just the matter of finding one.
 </P>
 <p>


Talking about the values:-
We all have our core values and some of mine are: 1) Family is the most important.
2) Honesty and Trust
3) Commitment
4) Compassion
5) Respect
6) Perserverance
7) Positivity
8) Education
9) Open-mindedness
these are some of the main values of me and my family and there are some more.
I stand for all my core values.</p>

<P>
The resilience ideas and meditaion excercise.. I feel  this will summerize for me in the following metaphore..
“If you have access to a deep inner calm in your mind, then no matter the ups and downs of day-to-day life, you can always be resilient.
 Nothing can get you down for a prolonged period of time because every time something beats you down, you can always rest and recover in that ”

Excerpt From: Tan, Chade-Meng.</P>
