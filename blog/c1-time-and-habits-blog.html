        <p class="blog-text answer">
          This is my second week of studying the material for this course.
          I have been experimenting myself with managing my time and habits.
           It is very important for me to work around my kids routine there homework and activites.
            I am trying to time box myself in the moring when kids are not home.
            I give myself couple of hours to read and re read if I don't understand some concepts.
             The best thing is I am trying to do this since the day one as I started the course which I am hoping to turn into the habit one day.
        <br />
            The intresting thing so far I have found is,
            I get easily distracted if I don't find the concept challenging my time.
             It's weird but true. I hope it changes in a good way.


            I have always been a person who likes to plan, orgnaise  and make my own schedule and work accordingly. I like to know what's on my list and what are my priorities. This has been something which have always worked best for me. But there is always a chance of improvement.


            With having kids I will try and work more on small time boxing concept in a future and make a habit.
            As someone said "Practice should be hard  but in a small iterations"
            "Great things start small"
