  <h1>Time boxing and Habits</h1>
<p>
  This is my second week of studying the material for this course. I have been experimenting myself with managing my time and habits. It is very important for me to work around my kids routine there homework and activites. I am trying to time box myself in the moring when kids are not home. I give myself couple of hours to read and re read if I don't understand some concepts. The best thing is I am trying to do this since the day one as I started the course which I am hoping to turn into the habit one day.
<p>
  The intresting thing so far I have found is, I get easily distracted if I don't find the concept challenging my time. It's weird but true. I hope it changes in a good way.

  I have always been a person who likes to plan, orgnaise  and make my own schedule and work accordingly. I like to know what's on my list and what are my prorities. This has been something which have always worked best for me. But there is always a chance of improvement.

<p>
  With having kids I will try and work more on small time boxing concept in a future and make a habit.
  As someone said "Practice should be hard  but in a small iterations"
  "Great things start small"
