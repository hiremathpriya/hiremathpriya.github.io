          Mindfullness and self awareness share very close relationship as we know mindfulness is a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment,
          while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. whereas Self Awareness is having a clear perception of your personality,
          including strengths, weaknesses, thoughts, beliefs, motivation, and emotions. Self Awareness allows you to understand other people,
          how they perceive you, your attitude and your responses to them in the moment. ..
          when you start to acknowledging your feelings, thoughts and bodily sensations,
          you will also start acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, your emotions etc so in other words, I feel mindfulness and self awareness are the  two sides of a one coin.

 I have been practicing body scan technique from quite some time now and it is hard to focus and gather your attention, sometimes you feel you have to work too hard to focus and sometimes your mind keeps wondering around. but saying that with everyday practice it does gives you peace and calmness.

 Before you are going to experience any emotion if you know “emotions are simply what you feel, not who you are. Emotions go from being existential (“I am”) to experiential (“I feel”).”
