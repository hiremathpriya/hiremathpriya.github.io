  <p>After watching Shereef's video and knowing a little more about DBC/EDA. I definatly feel it's a
    brave approch to learn something extra oridinary in a few weeks span.
    I feel it is something for people who likes to take challenges, people who are ready to dive in and give there best. <br />
    I like there values and over all approch to the learning. (like an example by Shereef about Kitchen vs table approch)<br />
    My impression about this whole experince is anything is possible if you give your 100% and work
    hard.
    I am looking forward to engage in this culture where I will meet intersting people from different backgrounds who  will learn, share and grow together with me, and buliding
    new community.<br />
    I have heard EDA's experience is a fun, even though it is going to be a hard work. I am being positive and motivated.<br />
    Every new step in my life makes  me nervous as it brings it's own challenges and hardship. But building the courage to go ahead is the key to calm my nervs.
