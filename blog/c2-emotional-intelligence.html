      <p>I have to start by saying  emotional intelligence starts by "Just being in the present moment"
         and experience the goodness it brings to all of us. There are quite a few things I have
        learned from this chapter they are as follows.Being optimistic that emotional intelligence is one of the best predictors of success at work and
        fulfillment in life “The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions,
        to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.
        Emotional competencies are something you can deliberately acquire with practice.
    <ol>
    <li>Self-awareness: Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions</li>
    <li> Self-regulation: Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources</li>
    <li>Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</li>
     <li>Empathy: Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns </li><br />

    Emotional intelligence enables three important skill sets: stellar work performance,
    outstanding leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness.
    </p>
    <p>I have been practising Mindfullness for quite some time now. As being in present moment works for
      your happiness as well as for your general well being. I also feel mindfullness is not just being able
      to sit down and focus on your breathing. Mindfullness can be anything what one likes to do and get
      joy out of it. For example I feel my mindfullness is when I cook something, That is time when I am
      completely invovled in that present moment without having any other thoghts in mind.
      I am just being me. It helps you to calm down and increase your focus and attention ultimatly releasing
      happy emotions.I definitely feel the advantages of the mindfullness practise.
