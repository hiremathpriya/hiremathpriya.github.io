              I think it is still quite early for me to explian in detail what are the powers of
              HTML,CSS and DOM are, but HTML is like the bones and skin of a website's page.  It will give
              basics to work with where as CSS will make it look beautiful, at the end DOM will bring them
              togehter and express it's content on a webpage.
              If I have to explain it to my non-technical friend I will probably say "HTML is like a fashion
              model with her bones and skin and flesh which she has worked hard on to get into the Modelling
              industry.Css is like a desinger who will make the Model looks as beatiful as poosible
              with using all sorts of Make-up tricks, cloths, shoes, hair etc..and last but not the least
              DOM who will teach this Model how to walk on the Run-way.

            <p>
              Boxifying design refers to the fact that all the elements
              we see on a webpage are generally contained within boxes - rectangular shapes!  when we make
              designs using boxes as a blueprint it is easy to understand and manipulate the page the way we want.
              Also with my limited knowledge, I feel when you boxify  the content's of the webpage  it is easy to code,and
              keep it tidy and clean so it is readable
              by whoever will work on it.

                  What is the box model?

                The CSS box model is a way to manipulate the rectangular elements in HTML, using attributes like 'margin', 'border', 'padding' and 'content'.
                While these have specific meanings in the context of CSS, you can imagine,
                generally speaking, which aspects of an HTML element these will affect.
