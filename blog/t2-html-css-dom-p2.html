            <p>Grid base design is two dimensional where it is made up with the series of
              interesting straight, verttical or horizontal lines used to structure the content.
              Grid base design follows a pattern where we start from top and top bottom.
              Almost every webpage follows some sort of grid base pattern or design.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the hype about responsive design today is because now a days people
              are using more and more devices like Tablets,Phones etc. Saying that all these
              devices has got a different size of screens to show the same content of the
              web-page. when we say size of the screen it's actually the pixals which are
              changing the size of page to fit.
              With responsive desgin your web-page will not be fixed to single size
              and it will response correctly with no matter which device you are using.
              It will show the content correctly, great and eligible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Semantic structure helps orgnaise the content on the web-page in more sensible
              way. Semantic structure uses tags which are like header,where you can have
              h1 to h6 tags, also Images,Form etc.
              Semantic structure tags make sense to not only for the browser but also for humans
              looking at it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have found the whole grid structure very interesting also it's quite confusing.
              I would like to spend some more time exploring this again.
