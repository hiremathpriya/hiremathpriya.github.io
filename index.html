    Welcome to my first index.html page.Here you will see how I have started my tech journey.
     You can go ahead and explore the page.
     Feel free to send me some suggestions and help me learn more..
    I am going to try adding new feature to my page. when I was reading about css zen garden I liked
      backdround of one of the webpage. I still haven't tried doing that so far. So I have decided
      to do it for my page. Let's see if it actually works and looks the way I am expceting to work.
      Even though it seems like there is bit of a Java script playing part.
      I am now going to add Background Image here

  <p><h3> "Box-shadow and Boxes"</h3>
    I have added Box-shadow and boxes around some content this is the new feature this week to my home page.
     It was interesting to explore
     power of css.</p>
