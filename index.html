    I am going to try adding new feature to my page. when I was reading about css zen garden I liked <thead>
      backdround of one of the webpage. I still haven't tried doing that so far. So I have decided
      to do it for my page. Let's see if it actually works and looks the way I am expceting to work.
      Even though it seems like there is bit of a Java script playing part.
      I am now going to add Background Image here
