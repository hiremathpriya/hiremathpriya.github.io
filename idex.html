  <h1>"Tech Story Then"</h1>
  <h2>'When world was in a creative mode'</h2>
  <h3> My Mum and Me</h3>
  <p>Long time back when I was  a little child life was  simple and straight forward. All we did was go to school come back and play with our friends. The whole neigbourhood was there having fun and getting fit, laughing, sharing there day's events. Kids were just being kids.

  </p>
  <p> On the other side while we were asleep there were some very smart people working on to changing the world, they were busy making tools which would make human beings life much more comfortable and which will conncet the world together. The role they were playing was being exremely creative and imagnative.  Life was all about to change the first tchnology emerged at my home was the television then came the landline...

  </p>
  <p> My Mum's world was changed now she knew there is a lot in the world to see and experience all that just a touch of a button.
    And then telephone arrived and she was over the moon as now she could keep in touch and listen to her children's voice from far. And  her life was changed for good.
